# CNN-Mnist-classification-and-LSTM-melody-generation

This repository presents two miniprojects done at EPFL. 

First one is tackling the task of classifying cropped, downsampled and grayscaled images of house numbers in the [The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/). We are fitting different NN architectures (FC layers and convolutional layers), in order to resolve this task.

The second project, uses large database of [Irish folk melodies](https://github.com/IraKorshunova/folk-rnn/tree/master/data). We designe recurrent neural networks in keras and fit them to data. Final model is used for symbolic music composition.
